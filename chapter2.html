<div class="article">
    <p>"Ahh... ha... uwahh!"</p>
    <p>The sword, swinging to these strange shouts, swished around cutting nothing but air.</p>
    <p>Right afterwards, the blue boar, which moved surprisingly quick considering its bulk, charged fiercely at its assailant. I burst into laughter after watching him fly through the air after getting hit by the boar's flat nose and roll on the hill.</p>
    <p>"Hahaha...not like that. The first movement is important, Cline."</p>
    <p>"Argh...that bastard."</p>
    <p>The complaining assailant, a party member called Cline, got up and glanced at me while answering plaintively.</p>
    <p>"But Kirito, even if you say that... I can't do anything about the fact that it's moving."</p>
    <p>I met this person, who had reddish hair held up by a bandana and simple leather armor worn over his thin body, a few hours ago. If he had revealed his real name, it would have been hard to omit the honorifics, but his name Cline and mine Kirito were both names we had made up for our characters. Putting "-san" or "-kun" at the end of them would sound comical more than anything.</p>
    <p>The legs of the person in question started shaking.</p>
    <p>Seems like he's a little dizzy.</p>
    <p>I picked up a pebble from the undergrowth at my feet and raised it above my shoulder. As soon as the system detected the first motion of a sword skill, the pebble started giving off a slight green light.</p>
    <p>After that, my left hand almost moved by itself and the pebble went flying, drawing a straight line of light and hitting the boar between its eyebrows. Ggiik! The boar squealed in fury and turned towards me.</p>
    <p>"Of course they move. They're not training dummies. But if you start the right motion, the system will put your sword skill into motion and hit the target for you."</p>
    <p>"Motion...motion..."</p>
    <p>While muttering this like some spell, Cline raised the cutlass that he had in his right hand.</p>
    <p>Although the blue boar, officially named «Frenzy Boar» was a level one monster, Cline had had almost half of his HP reduced while getting hit by counterattacks due to his wild swings. Well, even if he died he'd just respawn at the «Starting City» near here, but coming all the way out to this hunting ground again was somewhat annoying.</p>
    <p>It seemed like there was one move left before the fight reached its conclusion.</p>
    <p>I cocked my head as I blocked the boar's charge with the sword in my right hand.</p>
    <p>"Hmm, how should I explain... It's not like one, two, three then strike, but more like gathering a bit of energy and then. as soon as you feel the skill start, it goes BAM and you feel it hit the monster..."</p>
    <p>"Bam, eh?"</p>
    <p>Cline's roughly handsome face grimaced itself into an unsightly image as he leveled his sword with the middle of his body.</p>
    <p>Breathe in, and out; after taking a deep breath, he lowered his pose and raised his sword as if he was going to shoulder it. This time, the system sensed the pose correctly and the arcing sword slowly started shining orange.</p>
    <p>"Ha!"</p>
    <p>With his low yell, he jumped off the ground with a movement that was completely different to the ones before. Swish-! With this crisp sound, the sword drew its flame red trajectory through the air. The «Reaver», a basic skill of the one handed curved sword, struck the boar right in its neck as it was about to charge and got rid of the rest of its HP, which, like Cline's, was about half full.</p>
    <p>Guekk— it screamed a pitiful cry and its large body shattered like glass and purple numbers appeared, showing how much virtual experience points I gained.</p>
    <p>"Yeeeeaaaahhh!"</p>
    <p>Cline took an overstated pose of victory with a huge smile on his face and raised his left hand. I high-fived him and smiled again.</p>
    <p>"Congrats on your first victory...but that boar — it's about as hard as slimes from other games."</p>
    <p>"Eh, really? I thought it was some sort of semi-boss or something!"</p>
    <p>"No chance of that."</p>
    <p>My smile became a little forced as I sheathed my sword on my back.</p>
    <p>Even though I was teasing him, I understood what he was feeling right now. Since I had two more months of experience than him, it was only now that he could feel the exhilarating feeling of destroying his enemy by his own hand.</p>
    <p>Cline started to use the same sword skill over and over again yelling as he did so, perhaps as a way of practicing. I left him alone and looked around.</p>
    <p>The endlessly stretching plains gave off a beautiful red as the sun had started setting. Way up north, there was the silhouette of a forest, a sparkling lake down south, and I could just about make out the walls that surrounded the city to the east. To the west, there was a limitless sky going on forever with bunches of golden clouds drifting by.</p>
    <p>We were at the plains that stretched to the west of the «Starting City», which was situated at the north end of the first floor of the colossal floating castle—«Aincrad». There should be numerous players fighting monsters around here; but because of the enormous size, none of them were visible.</p>
    <p>Seeming finally satisfied, Cline sheathed his sword and walked over while observing the area as well.</p>
    <p>"But really...however many times I look around like this, I still can't believe that this is «inside the game»."</p>
    <p>"Well even if you say ‘inside' it's not like our souls were sucked in or anything. Our brain's just seeing and listening instead of our eyes and ears...with the signals that the «Nerve Gear» is sending."</p>
    <p>I said while shrugging. Cline pouted his lips like a kid.</p>
    <p>"You might be used to it now, but for me it's the first time doing a «FullDive»! Isn't it awesome? Really...it's a relief that I was born in this era!"</p>
    <p>"You're exaggerating."</p>
    <p>But as I laughed, I totally agreed with him.</p>
    <p>«Nerve Gear».</p>
    <p>That's the name of the hardware that moved this VRMMORPG—«Sword Art Online».</p>
    <p>The basic structure of this machine is totally different from the older ones.</p>
    <p>Unlike the old-style man-machine interface hardware like "flat screen monitors" or "controllers that you used with your hands," Nerve Gear only had a single interface, a streamlined interface that covered the whole of your head and face.</p>
    <p>Inside, there were numerous signal components, and by using the numerous electronic signals these sent, the gear accessed the user's brain itself. The user didn't use their eyes or ears to see and listen, but took in the signals that were sent directly to their brain. In addition, the machine could access not only sight and sound, but also touch, taste, and smell as well—that is to say, all five senses.</p>
    <p>After slipping the Nerve Gear on and locking the strap on your chin in place and saying the initiation command «Link Start», all noise fades away and you're swathed in darkness. As soon as you pass the rainbow colored circle in the middle, you're in another world made entirely out of data.</p>
    <p>So,</p>
    <p>Half a year ago, this machine, which started selling in May, 2022, successfully created a «Virtual Reality». The electronics company which created the Nerve Gear called the actual act of linking to the virtual reality—</p>
    <p>«FullDive».</p>
    <p>It was a total seclusion from reality, fitting of the word "full."</p>
    <p>The reason for this is that the Nerve Gear not only sent fake signals to the five senses—but also blocked and rerouted the orders that the brain sent to the body.</p>
    <p>This can be called the most basic requirement for moving freely in a virtual reality. If the body received the brain's signals when the user was in FullDive, the moment the user decided they wanted to «run» their actual body would run into a wall.</p>
    <p>Because the Nerve Gear could reroute the commands the brain sent through the spinal cord, Cline and I could both move our avatars around freely and swing our swords around.</p>
    <p>We've completely leapt into the game.</p>
    <p>The effect of this experience captivated me and many gamers such as myself to the point where we were sure that we could never go back to the old touch-pens or motion sensors.</p>
    <p>Cline was staring at the wind passing through the plains and the castle walls off in the distance with actual tears in his eyes.</p>
    <p>"So SAO is the first game for the Nerve Gear that you've played?" I asked.</p>
    <p>Cline, looking like a calmly handsome warrior from the Sengoku period, turned his head my way and nodded.</p>
    <p>"Yeah."</p>
    <p>If he put a serious expression on his face, he had an impressive bearing about him worthy of an actor from a historical play. Of course, this was different from his actual body in the real world. It was an avatar made out of nothing from adjusting a bunch of options.</p>
    <p>Of course, I looked like some ridiculously handsome protagonist from some fantasy animation as well.</p>
    <p>Cline continued in his low vigorous voice, which, of course, was different from his real voice as well.</p>
    <p>"Well, to be exact, I sorta bought the hardware in a rush after I managed to get my hands on SAO. There was only ten thousand in the first batch. So I suppose I was really lucky. ...well,if I think about it you were ten times luckier when you got picked for beta testing. They only picked a thousand!"</p>
    <p>"An, yeah, I suppose."</p>
    <p>Cline kept staring at me. I unconsciously scratched my head.</p>
    <p>I remembered the excitement and enthusiasm that «Sword Art Online» created when it was announced through the media like it was yesterday.</p>
    <p>Nerve Gear had realized the future setting for gaming with FullDive. However, due to the innovation of the actual machine, only unremarkable titles came forth for the all-important software. They were all puzzles, education related or environmental type games, calling forth discontent from game addicts such as myself.</p>
    <p>Nerve Gear can truthfully render a virtual reality.</p>
    <p>But you could only walk 100 meters before you hit a wall in that world; it was really a huge letdown. That hardcore gamers such as myself, who had been deeply absorbed with the experience of being within the game, had started waiting for a certain game genre was almost unavoidable.</p>
    <p>We had started waiting for a network response game—a sort that let millions of players log in and raise, fight with and live as a character of their own, that is to say—a MMORPG.</p>
    <p>When the anticipation and craving reached its limit, the first VRMMORPG was announced just in time, «Sword Art Online». The stage for the game is a floating castle consisting of 100 floors.</p>
    <p>The players lived in a world with forests and lakes, relying on only their sword and drive to discover the route to the upper floors and defeat countless monsters and make their way endlessly to the top.</p>
    <p>«Magic» which was considered to be an indispensable part of fantasy MMORPGs had been boldly cut out and an almost endless number of skills called «Sword Skills» were made. It was part of a plan to let players actually feel the experience of fighting with their own bodies through FullDive as much as possible.</p>
    <p>Skills were varied including productive skills such as smithery, leather working and sewing, and everyday skills such as fishing, cooking and playing music, allowing the player to not only adventure the huge game but also actually «live» in it. If they so wanted, and if their skill levels were high enough, they could buy a house and live as shepherds.</p>
    <p>As the information steadily kept being revealed, the gamers' enthusiasm only got higher.</p>
    <p>The beta test only recruited a thousand testers; it's said that one hundred thousand people, the number of half the Nerve Gear sold at that time, volunteered to be a tester. Luck was the only reason that I got through the narrow gap and was picked. Also, beta testers received the additional benefit of being given the priority when the game officially came out.</p>
    <p>The two months of beta testing was like a dream. At school, I thought endlessly of my skill set, equipment and items, and ran all the way to my house as soon as school ended and dived till dawn. The beta test ended in the blink of an eye, and on the day my character was reset, I felt a sense of loss as if half of my actual self had been cut away.</p>
    <p>And now—November 6, 2022, Sunday.</p>
    <p>«Sword Art Online» after all the preparations had been finished and at 1PM officially started its server service.</p>
    <p>Of course, I had been waiting for 30 minutes and then logged on without even a second delay, but when I checked the state of the server over ninety-five hundred people had already logged on. It seemed as if all of the people who had been lucky enough to get their hands on the game had felt the same as I did. All the online shopping sites announced that the game was sold out seconds after it had gone on sale and the offline sales, which had started yesterday, had created lines of people who had queued up for four days, creating enough of a racket to go on the news. That meant that all the people who had been able to buy a copy of the game were almost all serious game addicts.</p>
    <p>The actions of Cline showed this clearly as well.</p>
    <p>After I had logged onto SAO, I started running through the nostalgic stone paved roads of the «Starting City» to go to the weapons shop. Realizing that I was a beta tester after seeing me start and dashing without any hesitation, Cline ran over.</p>
    <p>"Hey, teach me a few things!" he'd begged.</p>
    <p>I wondered how he could be so shameless and demanding to a person he hadn't met before. Being so lost for words that it was almost amazement.</p>
    <p>"Ah, er, then...why don't we go to the weapon shop?" I answered like some NPC; we then ended up making a party, and I began teaching him some basics of fighting—and that's how we ended up in this current situation.</p>
    <p>To tell the truth, I didn't get along with people in real life or in games, perhaps even less so than in real life. During beta testing, I came to know a couple of people, but I didn't get close enough to anyone to actually call them a friend.</p>
    <p>But Cline had a side to him that grows on you, and I didn't find this uncomfortable either. Thinking that I might be able to get along with him, I opened my mouth.</p>
    <p>"So...what do you want to do? Do you want to keep hunting till you get used to it?"</p>
    <p>"Sure! ...is what I want to say, but..."</p>
    <p>Cline's delicate eyes looked at the bottom right of his vision. He must have been checking the time.</p>
    <p>"...well, I should log off and eat. I ordered some pizza for 5:30."</p>
    <p>"Pretty thorough."</p>
    <p>I said at a loss for words, Cline spread his chest.</p>
    <p>"Of course!" he said proudly. "I promised to meet some mates at the «Starting City» in a bit. I could introduce you to some of them and you could register them as friends. That way you would always send messages. How about it?"</p>
    <p>"Errr... Hmmm...," I mumbled subconsciously.</p>
    <p>got along with Cline pretty well, but there was no guarantee that it'd be the same for his friends. I felt like that there would be a higher chance of not getting along with them and as a result, fall out with Cline as well.</p>
    <p>"Should I...?"</p>
    <p>Seemingly understanding the reason for my not-so-confident answer, Cline shook his head.</p>
    <p>"Ah, I don't mean to force you. There'll be a chance to introduce them sometime anyway."</p>
    <p>"...yeah. Sorry, and thanks."</p>
    <p>As soon as I thanked him, Cline shook his head vigorously.</p>
    <p>"Hey, hey! I should be the one thanking you. I received a lot of help from you. I'll pay you back sometime soon. Mentally."</p>
    <p>Cline smiled and took another look at the clock.</p>
    <p>"...well, I'll log off for a bit. Thanks a lot, Kirito. Be seeing ya."</p>
    <p>With that, he put his hand forward. At that moment, I thought this person would have been a great leader in «another game» and shook his hand.</p>
    <p>"Yeah, see you around."</p>
    <p>We let go of each other's hand.</p>
    <p>That was the point where Aincrad, or Sword Art Online, stopped being just some fun game for me.</p>
    <p>Cline stepped back a bit and put his right index finger and thumb together and pulled downwards. This was the action that was done to call the «main menu window». Straight afterwards, there was a ringing sound and a shining purple rectangle appeared.</p>
    <p>I moved a bit and sat on a rock and opened my menu too. I started to move my fingers to organize the items that I'd gotten after fighting with the boar.</p>
    <p>Then.</p>
    <p>"Eh?" Cline said in a strange tone.</p>
    <p>"What's this? ...there's no log out button."</p>
    <p>At that, I stopped moving my fingers and raised my head.</p>
    <p>"No button...? No way, look a bit closer."</p>
    <p>I said a bit confused. The swordsman opened his eyes wide beneath the bandana and pushed his head closer to the menu. The rectangle, which was longer sideways than high, had a bunch of buttons on the left and a silhouette showing what equipment you had on on the right. At the bottom of the menu, there was a «LOG OUT» button that allowed you to escape from this world.</p>
    <p>As I was turning my head to the item list that listed the items that I had gained over hours of fighting, Cline started speaking in an unusually high voice.</p>
    <p>"It's really not there. You take a look Kirito."</p>
    <p>"I told you that there's no way that it's not there..." I muttered with a sigh as I clicked on the button on the top left to go back to the menu screen.</p>
    <p>The inventory window on the right closed and it went back to the main screen. At the left of the silhouette, which still had quite a lot of empty spaces, there was a long row of buttons.</p>
    <p>I moved my hand down in a movement that had almost become a habit and—</p>
    <p>My body froze.</p>
    <p>It wasn't here.</p>
    <p>As Cline had said, the button that had been there during the beta test—no, even right after I'd logged on—had disappeared.</p>
    <p>I stared at the empty space for a couple of seconds, then looked through the menu, making sure that it hadn't just changed its position. Cline looked up with "Right?" written on his face.</p>
    <p>"...not there, right?"</p>
    <p>"Yeah, it's not there."</p>
    <p>I nodded, although it felt slightly annoying to agree so easily. Cline smiled and started rubbing his thick chin.</p>
    <p>"Well, it's the first day so these sort of bugs could occur. Around about now, the GMs should be crying by now from the amount of messages flooding in," Cline said calmly.</p>
    <p>"Is it alright for you to stand around like that? You said that you ordered some pizza, didn't you?" I asked teasingly.</p>
    <p>"Ah, that's right!"</p>
    <p>I smiled as I watched him jump around, his eyes wide.</p>
    <p>I threw away a couple of items I didn't need from the inventory, which had turned red due to having too many items inside, and then walked over to Cline.</p>
    <p>"Argh! My anchovy pizza and ginger ale-!"</p>
    <p>"Why don't you call a GM? They might cut you off from their side."</p>
    <p>"I tried, but there's no response. It's already 5:25! Hey, Kirito! Isn't there some other way to log out?" After listening to what Cline said while waving both of his arms—</p>
    <p>My face became rigid. I felt a groundless fear send a chill down my back.</p>
    <p>"Let's see...to log out..." I said while thinking.</p>
    <p>To get out of this virtual reality and back to my room, I have to open the main menu, press the log out button and press yes on the window that popped up on the right. It was pretty simple. But—at the same time, apart from the procedure above I wasn't aware of any other way of logging off.</p>
    <p>I looked up at Cline's face, which was situated quite a bit higher than my own, and shook my head.</p>
    <p>"No...there's none. If you want to log out yourself you have to use the menu, apart from that, there's no other way."</p>
    <p>"That's impossible...there's got to be something!"</p>
    <p>Cline suddenly starting shouting as if he was denying my statement.</p>
    <p>"Return! Log out! Escape!"</p>
    <p>But of course, nothing happened. There were no voice commands on SAO of that description.</p>
    <p>After shouting this and that and even jumping, I spoke to Cline.</p>
    <p>"Cline, it's useless. Even the manual doesn't have anything on emergency access terminations."</p>
    <p>"But...this is just stupid! Even if it's a bug, I can't even go back to my room and my body when I want to!" Cline shouted with a bewildered expression on his face.</p>
    <p>I totally agreed with him.</p>
    <p>This was impossible. It was complete nonsense. But it was indisputably the truth.</p>
    <p>"Hey...what is this? It's really just weird. Right now, we can't get out of this game!"</p>
    <p>Cline gave out a desperate laugh then quickly started talking again.</p>
    <p>"Wait, we can just turn the power off. Or just pull the «Gear» off."</p>
    <p>As I watched Cline move his hands, as if he was trying to take off some invisible hat, I felt the anxiety returning.</p>
    <p>"That's impossible, both of them. Right now, we can't move our bodies...our real bodies. The «Nerve Gear» receives all the signals that our brain is sending here..." I tapped the back of my head. "... and reroutes them to move our avatars here."</p>
    <p>Cline slowly closed his mouth and put his hands down.</p>
    <p>We both stood speechless for a while, each lost in thought.</p>
    <p>To attain the FullDive state, the Nerve Gear blocks the signals that our brain sends down our spines and changes them so that we can control our avatars in this world. So however wildly we swing our arm about here, the arm of my real body, which was lying on my bed right now, wouldn't move an inch, ensuring that I wouldn't hit my head against the corner of my table or anything.</p>
    <p>But because of this function, we can't cancel the FullDive of our own free will right now.</p>
    <p>"...so unless the bug is fixed or somebody in the real world takes the Gear off, we have to wait it out?" Cline mumbled, still a little dazed.</p>
    <p>I silently signaled my agreement.</p>
    <p>"But I live by myself. You?"</p>
    <p>I hesitated slightly but told him the truth.</p>
    <p>"...I live with my mom and my younger sister, a family of three. I think that I'll be forced out of Dive if I don't come down for dinner..."</p>
    <p>"What? H-How old is your sister?"</p>
    <p>Cline suddenly looked at me, his eyes sparkling. I pushed his head away.</p>
    <p>"You're pretty calm right now, aren't you? She's part of the sports club and hates games, so she's got nothing in common with people like us...but more than that," I spread my right arm in an attempt to change the subject. "Don't you think it's weird?"</p>
    <p>"Well sure. Since it's a bug."</p>
    <p>"No, I mean it's not just a bug, it's an «impossible to log out» bug, it's a big enough problem to bother the operation of the game itself. Like your pizza in the real world is getting colder every second, it's an actual economical loss, isn't it?"</p>
    <p>"...a cold pizza...it's as meaningless as hard natto!"</p>
    <p>I ignored these meaningless comments and kept talking.</p>
    <p>"If it's like this, the operators should put the server down and log everyone out whatever the case. But...it's already been 15 minutes since we've noticed this, but there hasn't even been a system message, let alone putting the server down; it's just too weird."</p>
    <p>"Hmm, now that I think of it, you're right."</p>
    <p>Now Cline started rubbing his chin with a serious expression on his face. In the area beneath the bandana, which covered a little bit of his sharp nose, intelligence sparkled in his eyes.</p>
    <p>I started listening to Cline, feeling a little strange about talking with someone whom I'd never meet if I erased my account.</p>
    <p>"...the company which created SAO, «Argas», is a company that's famous for being considerate about its users, isn't it? That's why everyone was fighting to get their hands on a copy even though it's the first online game. It's sorta meaningless if they screw up like this on their first day."</p>
    <p>"I agree, and SAO is the first VRMMORPG. If something goes wrong now they might put down regulations for the genre itself."</p>
    <p>Cline and I looked at each other's virtual faces and sighed.</p>
    <p>Aincrad's seasons were based on reality, so it was early fall here as well.</p>
    <p>I looked up, sucking in the virtual air, taking a deep, cold breath.</p>
    <p>100 meters away, I could just about see the light purple bottom of the 2nd floor. As I followed the uneven surface, I saw the huge tower—the «labyrinth» that was the path to the upper floor—and saw that it was connected to the outer entrance.</p>
    <p>It was just past 5:30 and the small strip of sky that could be seen was red with the light of the sunset. Despite the situation I was in, seeing the endless plains painted gold with the light of the evening sun, I found myself speechless in front of the beauty of this virtual world.</p>
    <p>Right after that.</p>
    <p>The world changed forever.</p>

    <span>CHAPTER 2 END.</span>
</div>

<div class="full-article">
    <p>"Ahh... ha... uwahh!"</p>
    <p>The sword, swinging to these strange shouts, swished around cutting nothing but air.</p>
    <p>Right afterwards, the blue boar, which moved surprisingly quick considering its bulk, charged fiercely at its assailant. I burst into laughter after watching him fly through the air after getting hit by the boar's flat nose and roll on the hill.</p>
    <p>"Hahaha...not like that. The first movement is important, Cline."</p>
    <p>"Argh...that bastard."</p>
    <p>The complaining assailant, a party member called Cline, got up and glanced at me while answering plaintively.</p>
    <p>"But Kirito, even if you say that... I can't do anything about the fact that it's moving."</p>
    <p>I met this person, who had reddish hair held up by a bandana and simple leather armor worn over his thin body, a few hours ago. If he had revealed his real name, it would have been hard to omit the honorifics, but his name Cline and mine Kirito were both names we had made up for our characters. Putting "-san" or "-kun" at the end of them would sound comical more than anything.</p>
    <p>The legs of the person in question started shaking.</p>
    <p>Seems like he's a little dizzy.</p>
    <p>I picked up a pebble from the undergrowth at my feet and raised it above my shoulder. As soon as the system detected the first motion of a sword skill, the pebble started giving off a slight green light.</p>
    <p>After that, my left hand almost moved by itself and the pebble went flying, drawing a straight line of light and hitting the boar between its eyebrows. Ggiik! The boar squealed in fury and turned towards me.</p>
    <p>"Of course they move. They're not training dummies. But if you start the right motion, the system will put your sword skill into motion and hit the target for you."</p>
    <p>"Motion...motion..."</p>
    <p>While muttering this like some spell, Cline raised the cutlass that he had in his right hand.</p>
    <p>Although the blue boar, officially named «Frenzy Boar» was a level one monster, Cline had had almost half of his HP reduced while getting hit by counterattacks due to his wild swings. Well, even if he died he'd just respawn at the «Starting City» near here, but coming all the way out to this hunting ground again was somewhat annoying.</p>
    <p>It seemed like there was one move left before the fight reached its conclusion.</p>
    <p>I cocked my head as I blocked the boar's charge with the sword in my right hand.</p>
    <p>"Hmm, how should I explain... It's not like one, two, three then strike, but more like gathering a bit of energy and then. as soon as you feel the skill start, it goes BAM and you feel it hit the monster..."</p>
    <p>"Bam, eh?"</p>
    <p>Cline's roughly handsome face grimaced itself into an unsightly image as he leveled his sword with the middle of his body.</p>
    <p>Breathe in, and out; after taking a deep breath, he lowered his pose and raised his sword as if he was going to shoulder it. This time, the system sensed the pose correctly and the arcing sword slowly started shining orange.</p>
    <p>"Ha!"</p>
    <p>With his low yell, he jumped off the ground with a movement that was completely different to the ones before. Swish-! With this crisp sound, the sword drew its flame red trajectory through the air. The «Reaver», a basic skill of the one handed curved sword, struck the boar right in its neck as it was about to charge and got rid of the rest of its HP, which, like Cline's, was about half full.</p>
    <p>Guekk— it screamed a pitiful cry and its large body shattered like glass and purple numbers appeared, showing how much virtual experience points I gained.</p>
    <p>"Yeeeeaaaahhh!"</p>
    <p>Cline took an overstated pose of victory with a huge smile on his face and raised his left hand. I high-fived him and smiled again.</p>
    <p>"Congrats on your first victory...but that boar — it's about as hard as slimes from other games."</p>
    <p>"Eh, really? I thought it was some sort of semi-boss or something!"</p>
    <p>"No chance of that."</p>
    <p>My smile became a little forced as I sheathed my sword on my back.</p>
    <p>Even though I was teasing him, I understood what he was feeling right now. Since I had two more months of experience than him, it was only now that he could feel the exhilarating feeling of destroying his enemy by his own hand.</p>
    <p>Cline started to use the same sword skill over and over again yelling as he did so, perhaps as a way of practicing. I left him alone and looked around.</p>
    <p>The endlessly stretching plains gave off a beautiful red as the sun had started setting. Way up north, there was the silhouette of a forest, a sparkling lake down south, and I could just about make out the walls that surrounded the city to the east. To the west, there was a limitless sky going on forever with bunches of golden clouds drifting by.</p>
    <p>We were at the plains that stretched to the west of the «Starting City», which was situated at the north end of the first floor of the colossal floating castle—«Aincrad». There should be numerous players fighting monsters around here; but because of the enormous size, none of them were visible.</p>
    <p>Seeming finally satisfied, Cline sheathed his sword and walked over while observing the area as well.</p>
    <p>"But really...however many times I look around like this, I still can't believe that this is «inside the game»."</p>
    <p>"Well even if you say ‘inside' it's not like our souls were sucked in or anything. Our brain's just seeing and listening instead of our eyes and ears...with the signals that the «Nerve Gear» is sending."</p>
    <p>I said while shrugging. Cline pouted his lips like a kid.</p>
    <p>"You might be used to it now, but for me it's the first time doing a «FullDive»! Isn't it awesome? Really...it's a relief that I was born in this era!"</p>
    <p>"You're exaggerating."</p>
    <p>But as I laughed, I totally agreed with him.</p>
    <p>«Nerve Gear».</p>
    <p>That's the name of the hardware that moved this VRMMORPG—«Sword Art Online».</p>
    <p>The basic structure of this machine is totally different from the older ones.</p>
    <p>Unlike the old-style man-machine interface hardware like "flat screen monitors" or "controllers that you used with your hands," Nerve Gear only had a single interface, a streamlined interface that covered the whole of your head and face.</p>
    <p>Inside, there were numerous signal components, and by using the numerous electronic signals these sent, the gear accessed the user's brain itself. The user didn't use their eyes or ears to see and listen, but took in the signals that were sent directly to their brain. In addition, the machine could access not only sight and sound, but also touch, taste, and smell as well—that is to say, all five senses.</p>
    <p>After slipping the Nerve Gear on and locking the strap on your chin in place and saying the initiation command «Link Start», all noise fades away and you're swathed in darkness. As soon as you pass the rainbow colored circle in the middle, you're in another world made entirely out of data.</p>
    <p>So,</p>
    <p>Half a year ago, this machine, which started selling in May, 2022, successfully created a «Virtual Reality». The electronics company which created the Nerve Gear called the actual act of linking to the virtual reality—</p>
    <p>«FullDive».</p>
    <p>It was a total seclusion from reality, fitting of the word "full."</p>
    <p>The reason for this is that the Nerve Gear not only sent fake signals to the five senses—but also blocked and rerouted the orders that the brain sent to the body.</p>
    <p>This can be called the most basic requirement for moving freely in a virtual reality. If the body received the brain's signals when the user was in FullDive, the moment the user decided they wanted to «run» their actual body would run into a wall.</p>
    <p>Because the Nerve Gear could reroute the commands the brain sent through the spinal cord, Cline and I could both move our avatars around freely and swing our swords around.</p>
    <p>We've completely leapt into the game.</p>
    <p>The effect of this experience captivated me and many gamers such as myself to the point where we were sure that we could never go back to the old touch-pens or motion sensors.</p>
    <p>Cline was staring at the wind passing through the plains and the castle walls off in the distance with actual tears in his eyes.</p>
    <p>"So SAO is the first game for the Nerve Gear that you've played?" I asked.</p>
    <p>Cline, looking like a calmly handsome warrior from the Sengoku period, turned his head my way and nodded.</p>
    <p>"Yeah."</p>
    <p>If he put a serious expression on his face, he had an impressive bearing about him worthy of an actor from a historical play. Of course, this was different from his actual body in the real world. It was an avatar made out of nothing from adjusting a bunch of options.</p>
    <p>Of course, I looked like some ridiculously handsome protagonist from some fantasy animation as well.</p>
    <p>Cline continued in his low vigorous voice, which, of course, was different from his real voice as well.</p>
    <p>"Well, to be exact, I sorta bought the hardware in a rush after I managed to get my hands on SAO. There was only ten thousand in the first batch. So I suppose I was really lucky. ...well,if I think about it you were ten times luckier when you got picked for beta testing. They only picked a thousand!"</p>
    <p>"An, yeah, I suppose."</p>
    <p>Cline kept staring at me. I unconsciously scratched my head.</p>
    <p>I remembered the excitement and enthusiasm that «Sword Art Online» created when it was announced through the media like it was yesterday.</p>
    <p>Nerve Gear had realized the future setting for gaming with FullDive. However, due to the innovation of the actual machine, only unremarkable titles came forth for the all-important software. They were all puzzles, education related or environmental type games, calling forth discontent from game addicts such as myself.</p>
    <p>Nerve Gear can truthfully render a virtual reality.</p>
    <p>But you could only walk 100 meters before you hit a wall in that world; it was really a huge letdown. That hardcore gamers such as myself, who had been deeply absorbed with the experience of being within the game, had started waiting for a certain game genre was almost unavoidable.</p>
    <p>We had started waiting for a network response game—a sort that let millions of players log in and raise, fight with and live as a character of their own, that is to say—a MMORPG.</p>
    <p>When the anticipation and craving reached its limit, the first VRMMORPG was announced just in time, «Sword Art Online». The stage for the game is a floating castle consisting of 100 floors.</p>
    <p>The players lived in a world with forests and lakes, relying on only their sword and drive to discover the route to the upper floors and defeat countless monsters and make their way endlessly to the top.</p>
    <p>«Magic» which was considered to be an indispensable part of fantasy MMORPGs had been boldly cut out and an almost endless number of skills called «Sword Skills» were made. It was part of a plan to let players actually feel the experience of fighting with their own bodies through FullDive as much as possible.</p>
    <p>Skills were varied including productive skills such as smithery, leather working and sewing, and everyday skills such as fishing, cooking and playing music, allowing the player to not only adventure the huge game but also actually «live» in it. If they so wanted, and if their skill levels were high enough, they could buy a house and live as shepherds.</p>
    <p>As the information steadily kept being revealed, the gamers' enthusiasm only got higher.</p>
    <p>The beta test only recruited a thousand testers; it's said that one hundred thousand people, the number of half the Nerve Gear sold at that time, volunteered to be a tester. Luck was the only reason that I got through the narrow gap and was picked. Also, beta testers received the additional benefit of being given the priority when the game officially came out.</p>
    <p>The two months of beta testing was like a dream. At school, I thought endlessly of my skill set, equipment and items, and ran all the way to my house as soon as school ended and dived till dawn. The beta test ended in the blink of an eye, and on the day my character was reset, I felt a sense of loss as if half of my actual self had been cut away.</p>
    <p>And now—November 6, 2022, Sunday.</p>
    <p>«Sword Art Online» after all the preparations had been finished and at 1PM officially started its server service.</p>
    <p>Of course, I had been waiting for 30 minutes and then logged on without even a second delay, but when I checked the state of the server over ninety-five hundred people had already logged on. It seemed as if all of the people who had been lucky enough to get their hands on the game had felt the same as I did. All the online shopping sites announced that the game was sold out seconds after it had gone on sale and the offline sales, which had started yesterday, had created lines of people who had queued up for four days, creating enough of a racket to go on the news. That meant that all the people who had been able to buy a copy of the game were almost all serious game addicts.</p>
    <p>The actions of Cline showed this clearly as well.</p>
    <p>After I had logged onto SAO, I started running through the nostalgic stone paved roads of the «Starting City» to go to the weapons shop. Realizing that I was a beta tester after seeing me start and dashing without any hesitation, Cline ran over.</p>
    <p>"Hey, teach me a few things!" he'd begged.</p>
    <p>I wondered how he could be so shameless and demanding to a person he hadn't met before. Being so lost for words that it was almost amazement.</p>
    <p>"Ah, er, then...why don't we go to the weapon shop?" I answered like some NPC; we then ended up making a party, and I began teaching him some basics of fighting—and that's how we ended up in this current situation.</p>
    <p>To tell the truth, I didn't get along with people in real life or in games, perhaps even less so than in real life. During beta testing, I came to know a couple of people, but I didn't get close enough to anyone to actually call them a friend.</p>
    <p>But Cline had a side to him that grows on you, and I didn't find this uncomfortable either. Thinking that I might be able to get along with him, I opened my mouth.</p>
    <p>"So...what do you want to do? Do you want to keep hunting till you get used to it?"</p>
    <p>"Sure! ...is what I want to say, but..."</p>
    <p>Cline's delicate eyes looked at the bottom right of his vision. He must have been checking the time.</p>
    <p>"...well, I should log off and eat. I ordered some pizza for 5:30."</p>
    <p>"Pretty thorough."</p>
    <p>I said at a loss for words, Cline spread his chest.</p>
    <p>"Of course!" he said proudly. "I promised to meet some mates at the «Starting City» in a bit. I could introduce you to some of them and you could register them as friends. That way you would always send messages. How about it?"</p>
    <p>"Errr... Hmmm...," I mumbled subconsciously.</p>
    <p>got along with Cline pretty well, but there was no guarantee that it'd be the same for his friends. I felt like that there would be a higher chance of not getting along with them and as a result, fall out with Cline as well.</p>
    <p>"Should I...?"</p>
    <p>Seemingly understanding the reason for my not-so-confident answer, Cline shook his head.</p>
    <p>"Ah, I don't mean to force you. There'll be a chance to introduce them sometime anyway."</p>
    <p>"...yeah. Sorry, and thanks."</p>
    <p>As soon as I thanked him, Cline shook his head vigorously.</p>
    <p>"Hey, hey! I should be the one thanking you. I received a lot of help from you. I'll pay you back sometime soon. Mentally."</p>
    <p>Cline smiled and took another look at the clock.</p>
    <p>"...well, I'll log off for a bit. Thanks a lot, Kirito. Be seeing ya."</p>
    <p>With that, he put his hand forward. At that moment, I thought this person would have been a great leader in «another game» and shook his hand.</p>
    <p>"Yeah, see you around."</p>
    <p>We let go of each other's hand.</p>
    <p>That was the point where Aincrad, or Sword Art Online, stopped being just some fun game for me.</p>
    <p>Cline stepped back a bit and put his right index finger and thumb together and pulled downwards. This was the action that was done to call the «main menu window». Straight afterwards, there was a ringing sound and a shining purple rectangle appeared.</p>
    <p>I moved a bit and sat on a rock and opened my menu too. I started to move my fingers to organize the items that I'd gotten after fighting with the boar.</p>
    <p>Then.</p>
    <p>"Eh?" Cline said in a strange tone.</p>
    <p>"What's this? ...there's no log out button."</p>
    <p>At that, I stopped moving my fingers and raised my head.</p>
    <p>"No button...? No way, look a bit closer."</p>
    <p>I said a bit confused. The swordsman opened his eyes wide beneath the bandana and pushed his head closer to the menu. The rectangle, which was longer sideways than high, had a bunch of buttons on the left and a silhouette showing what equipment you had on on the right. At the bottom of the menu, there was a «LOG OUT» button that allowed you to escape from this world.</p>
    <p>As I was turning my head to the item list that listed the items that I had gained over hours of fighting, Cline started speaking in an unusually high voice.</p>
    <p>"It's really not there. You take a look Kirito."</p>
    <p>"I told you that there's no way that it's not there..." I muttered with a sigh as I clicked on the button on the top left to go back to the menu screen.</p>
    <p>The inventory window on the right closed and it went back to the main screen. At the left of the silhouette, which still had quite a lot of empty spaces, there was a long row of buttons.</p>
    <p>I moved my hand down in a movement that had almost become a habit and—</p>
    <p>My body froze.</p>
    <p>It wasn't here.</p>
    <p>As Cline had said, the button that had been there during the beta test—no, even right after I'd logged on—had disappeared.</p>
    <p>I stared at the empty space for a couple of seconds, then looked through the menu, making sure that it hadn't just changed its position. Cline looked up with "Right?" written on his face.</p>
    <p>"...not there, right?"</p>
    <p>"Yeah, it's not there."</p>
    <p>I nodded, although it felt slightly annoying to agree so easily. Cline smiled and started rubbing his thick chin.</p>
    <p>"Well, it's the first day so these sort of bugs could occur. Around about now, the GMs should be crying by now from the amount of messages flooding in," Cline said calmly.</p>
    <p>"Is it alright for you to stand around like that? You said that you ordered some pizza, didn't you?" I asked teasingly.</p>
    <p>"Ah, that's right!"</p>
    <p>I smiled as I watched him jump around, his eyes wide.</p>
    <p>I threw away a couple of items I didn't need from the inventory, which had turned red due to having too many items inside, and then walked over to Cline.</p>
    <p>"Argh! My anchovy pizza and ginger ale-!"</p>
    <p>"Why don't you call a GM? They might cut you off from their side."</p>
    <p>"I tried, but there's no response. It's already 5:25! Hey, Kirito! Isn't there some other way to log out?" After listening to what Cline said while waving both of his arms—</p>
    <p>My face became rigid. I felt a groundless fear send a chill down my back.</p>
    <p>"Let's see...to log out..." I said while thinking.</p>
    <p>To get out of this virtual reality and back to my room, I have to open the main menu, press the log out button and press yes on the window that popped up on the right. It was pretty simple. But—at the same time, apart from the procedure above I wasn't aware of any other way of logging off.</p>
    <p>I looked up at Cline's face, which was situated quite a bit higher than my own, and shook my head.</p>
    <p>"No...there's none. If you want to log out yourself you have to use the menu, apart from that, there's no other way."</p>
    <p>"That's impossible...there's got to be something!"</p>
    <p>Cline suddenly starting shouting as if he was denying my statement.</p>
    <p>"Return! Log out! Escape!"</p>
    <p>But of course, nothing happened. There were no voice commands on SAO of that description.</p>
    <p>After shouting this and that and even jumping, I spoke to Cline.</p>
    <p>"Cline, it's useless. Even the manual doesn't have anything on emergency access terminations."</p>
    <p>"But...this is just stupid! Even if it's a bug, I can't even go back to my room and my body when I want to!" Cline shouted with a bewildered expression on his face.</p>
    <p>I totally agreed with him.</p>
    <p>This was impossible. It was complete nonsense. But it was indisputably the truth.</p>
    <p>"Hey...what is this? It's really just weird. Right now, we can't get out of this game!"</p>
    <p>Cline gave out a desperate laugh then quickly started talking again.</p>
    <p>"Wait, we can just turn the power off. Or just pull the «Gear» off."</p>
    <p>As I watched Cline move his hands, as if he was trying to take off some invisible hat, I felt the anxiety returning.</p>
    <p>"That's impossible, both of them. Right now, we can't move our bodies...our real bodies. The «Nerve Gear» receives all the signals that our brain is sending here..." I tapped the back of my head. "... and reroutes them to move our avatars here."</p>
    <p>Cline slowly closed his mouth and put his hands down.</p>
    <p>We both stood speechless for a while, each lost in thought.</p>
    <p>To attain the FullDive state, the Nerve Gear blocks the signals that our brain sends down our spines and changes them so that we can control our avatars in this world. So however wildly we swing our arm about here, the arm of my real body, which was lying on my bed right now, wouldn't move an inch, ensuring that I wouldn't hit my head against the corner of my table or anything.</p>
    <p>But because of this function, we can't cancel the FullDive of our own free will right now.</p>
    <p>"...so unless the bug is fixed or somebody in the real world takes the Gear off, we have to wait it out?" Cline mumbled, still a little dazed.</p>
    <p>I silently signaled my agreement.</p>
    <p>"But I live by myself. You?"</p>
    <p>I hesitated slightly but told him the truth.</p>
    <p>"...I live with my mom and my younger sister, a family of three. I think that I'll be forced out of Dive if I don't come down for dinner..."</p>
    <p>"What? H-How old is your sister?"</p>
    <p>Cline suddenly looked at me, his eyes sparkling. I pushed his head away.</p>
    <p>"You're pretty calm right now, aren't you? She's part of the sports club and hates games, so she's got nothing in common with people like us...but more than that," I spread my right arm in an attempt to change the subject. "Don't you think it's weird?"</p>
    <p>"Well sure. Since it's a bug."</p>
    <p>"No, I mean it's not just a bug, it's an «impossible to log out» bug, it's a big enough problem to bother the operation of the game itself. Like your pizza in the real world is getting colder every second, it's an actual economical loss, isn't it?"</p>
    <p>"...a cold pizza...it's as meaningless as hard natto!"</p>
    <p>I ignored these meaningless comments and kept talking.</p>
    <p>"If it's like this, the operators should put the server down and log everyone out whatever the case. But...it's already been 15 minutes since we've noticed this, but there hasn't even been a system message, let alone putting the server down; it's just too weird."</p>
    <p>"Hmm, now that I think of it, you're right."</p>
    <p>Now Cline started rubbing his chin with a serious expression on his face. In the area beneath the bandana, which covered a little bit of his sharp nose, intelligence sparkled in his eyes.</p>
    <p>I started listening to Cline, feeling a little strange about talking with someone whom I'd never meet if I erased my account.</p>
    <p>"...the company which created SAO, «Argas», is a company that's famous for being considerate about its users, isn't it? That's why everyone was fighting to get their hands on a copy even though it's the first online game. It's sorta meaningless if they screw up like this on their first day."</p>
    <p>"I agree, and SAO is the first VRMMORPG. If something goes wrong now they might put down regulations for the genre itself."</p>
    <p>Cline and I looked at each other's virtual faces and sighed.</p>
    <p>Aincrad's seasons were based on reality, so it was early fall here as well.</p>
    <p>I looked up, sucking in the virtual air, taking a deep, cold breath.</p>
    <p>100 meters away, I could just about see the light purple bottom of the 2nd floor. As I followed the uneven surface, I saw the huge tower—the «labyrinth» that was the path to the upper floor—and saw that it was connected to the outer entrance.</p>
    <p>It was just past 5:30 and the small strip of sky that could be seen was red with the light of the sunset. Despite the situation I was in, seeing the endless plains painted gold with the light of the evening sun, I found myself speechless in front of the beauty of this virtual world.</p>
    <p>Right after that.</p>
    <p>The world changed forever.</p>
