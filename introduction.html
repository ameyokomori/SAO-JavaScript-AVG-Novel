                    first names respectively: (Kirigaya Kazuto). In the real world, he lives with his aunt and younger

                    she receives many invitations and proposals. She is a skilled player earning the title "Flash" for

                    to having trouble pronouncing their names which is a side effect of the memory loss. They decided

                    break any sword, so they formed a party and went on a journey to find the material she needed.

                <p class="character-plot-text-text">In 2022, a Virtual Reality Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing
                    Game (VRMMORPG) called Sword Art Online (SAO) is released. With the NerveGear, a helmet that
                    stimulates the user's five senses via their brain, players can experience and control their in-game
                    characters with their minds. Both the game and the NerveGear was created by Akihiko Kayaba.</p>
                <p class="character-plot-text-text">On November 6, 10,000 players log into the SAO's mainframe
                    cyberspace for the first time, only to discover that they are unable to log out. Kayaba appears and
                    tells the players that they must beat all 100 floors of Aincrad, a steel castle which is the setting
                    of SAO, if they wish to be free. Those who suffer in-game deaths or forcibly remove the NerveGear
                    out-of-game will suffer real-life deaths.</p>
                <p class="character-plot-text-text">One of the players named Kazuto "Kirito" Kirigaya is one of 1,000
                    testers in the game's previous closed beta. With the advantage of previous VR gaming experience and
                    a drive to protect other beta testers from discrimination, he isolates himself from the greater
                    group and plays the game alone, bearing the mantle of "beater", a "beta tester" and "cheater". As
                    the players progress through the game Kirito eventually befriends a young girl named Asuna Yūki,
                    forming a relationship with and later marrying her in-game. After the duo discover the identity of
                    Kayaba's secret ID, who was playing as the leader of the guild Asuna joined in, they confront and
                    destroy him, freeing themselves and the other players from the game.</p>
